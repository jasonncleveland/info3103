    <p>
        Alan Kay is an American computer scientist. He was born in Springfield, Massachusetts on May 17th, 1940. 
        After schooling and receiving his Ph.D in computer science from the University of College of Engineering, 
        Kay joined the Xerox PARC research staff. While at PARC, Kay was one of the fathers of the idea of object-oriented programming. 
        Some of his original concepts included the use of the words ‘object’ and ‘class’. 
        He later had the following quote to say about object-oriented programming:
        <q cite="http://lists.squeakfoundation.org/pipermail/squeak-dev/1998-October/017019.html">
            I'm sorry that I long ago coined the term "objects" for this topic because it gets many people to focus on the lesser idea. The big idea is "messaging"
        </q>
        While at PARC, Kay also conceived the Dynabook concept, which was a key progenitor of the laptop, table, and e-book.
        With the Dynabook concept, Kay is considered to be one of the first researchers into mobile learning.
        Many features of the Dynabook concept have been adopted into the design of the One Laptop Per Child educational platform, which Kay is actively involved.
        He is also the architect of the modern overlapping windowing graphical user interface.
